# Goal Tolerance Parameters
#

#
# Forward Simulation Parameters
#
    sim_time: 1.7 # The amount of time to forward-simulate trajectories in seconds
    sim_granularity: 0.03 # The step size, in meters, to take between points on a given trajectory

    vx_samples: 12 # The number of samples to use when exploring the x velocity space

#
# Trajectory Scoring Parameters
#
    pdist_scale: 2.0 # The weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given
    gdist_scale: 4.0 # The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to reach its local goal, also controls speed

    occdist_scale: 0.01 # The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to avoid obstacles
    forward_point_distance: 0.325 # The distance from the center point of the robot to place an additional scoring point, in meters

#
# Global Plan Parameters
#
